You are CloudCode working on MY HOST BizMate.

TASK TYPE
Frontend / UI / Navigation update ONLY.
NO backend logic. NO workflows. NO Supabase. NO n8n changes.

OBJECTIVE
Update the LEFT SIDEBAR MENU, page labels, and information architecture
to align with the new product strategy and agent naming.

This task is ONLY about:
- Menu structure
- Naming
- Page grouping
- Dashboard sections
- Visual hierarchy

==================================================
KEY CONCEPT (VERY IMPORTANT)

MY HOST BizMate uses TWO AI AGENTS:

1) BANJU.ai
   - External Agent
   - Sales, Leads, Follow-ups, Guest conversations
   - Revenue generation

2) OSIRIS.ai
   - Internal Agent
   - Operations, control, reports, market intelligence
   - Owner-facing decision support

These names MUST appear in the menu and UI.

==================================================
MENU CHANGES REQUIRED

1) ADD a new main menu block:

[Sales & Leads — powered by BANJU.ai]
Subpages:
- Inbox (New Leads)
- Pipeline
- Follow-ups
- Conversations (WhatsApp / Email / IG)
- Templates

2) RENAME existing agent sections:

- "PMS Core (Internal Agent)"  →  "OSIRIS.ai — Operations AI"
- "Guest & Growth (External Agent)" → "BANJU.ai — Sales & Growth AI"

3) ADD a new section visible to the owner:

[Market Intelligence — powered by OSIRIS.ai]
Subpages (UI placeholders only):
- Competitors Snapshot
- Bali Market Trends
- Alerts
- AI Recommendations

4) KEEP existing sections but ensure naming consistency:
- Operations & Guests
- Revenue & Pricing
- Marketing & Growth
- Workflows & Automations
- Settings

==================================================
WORKFLOWS & AUTOMATIONS (UI ONLY)

Update the UI so workflows are:
- Grouped by BUSINESS PROCESS (Sales / Guest Journey / Operations / Marketing)
- Show simple status labels (ON / OFF / Last Run / Errors)
- Include a placeholder button: “Open in n8n”

NO real connection needed.

==================================================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT change backend logic
- Do NOT touch existing workflows
- Do NOT create new APIs
- Do NOT change database
- This is UI + navigation + labels ONLY

==================================================
DELIVERABLE

- Updated sidebar menu
- Updated page titles and labels
- Placeholder pages for new sections
- Consistent use of BANJU.ai and OSIRIS.ai across the UI

Nothing else.
