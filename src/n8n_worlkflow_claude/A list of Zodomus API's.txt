It's easy to use our API's
Zodomus API's are REST API's with JSON requests and responses.
On the API reference, available after registration, you can get a detailed reference for each API.

Our API endpoint is : https://api.zodomus.com

All your API calls must use HTTPS and TLS 1.2
Zodomus uses Basic Authentication, with the API User and API Password keys provided in the backoffice.

Let's see some examples to call one simple API : https://api.zodomus.com/channels, to get a list of active channels.

curl:
                    
                    curl -u api_key_user:api_key_password -i -H 'Accept:application/json' https://api.zodomus.com/channels
                    
                    
Guzzle (Http client for PHP):
                    
                      $credentials = base64_encode($api_key_user.":".$api_key_password);

                      $client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

                      $url="https://api.zodomus.com/channels";

                      $response = $client->request('GET',$url, [

                       'headers' => [

                          'Authorization' => ['Basic '.$credentials],

                          'Content-type' => 'application/json; charset=UTF8'

                        ]

                      ]);
                      
                      
Python:
                      
                      import requests

                      from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

                      r = requests.post('https://api.zodomus.com/channels', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('api_key_user', 'api_key_password'))
                      
                      
C#:
                      
                      WebRequest req = WebRequest.Create(@"https://api.zodomus.com/channels");
                      req.Method = "GET";
                      req.Headers["Authorization"] = "Basic " + Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.Default.GetBytes("api_key_user:api_key_password"));
                      HttpWebResponse resp = req.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse;

PCI complaince and security
Anyone involved with the processing, transmission or storage of credit card data must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

Zodomus is PCI DSS compliant to store credit card data.

PCI compliance is a shared responsibility and applies to both Zodomus and your business.
If you are not PCI DSS compliant you should not store card data in your system, you should use Zodomus to access card data and not store it.
All our users must validate their PCI compliance if they need to access credit card data in Production.
If you don't store card data, usually you can do this with a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) provided by the PCI Security Standards Council.

If you need any help regarding security call our support team.

Your API calls must use HTTPS and a modern version of TLS (TLS 1.2 or bigger).
You get can a free certificate at Let's Encrypt or any other provider. TLS can be easily setup if you are a developer, but if you need help, please call our support.
You can check your SSL security using Qualys SSL Labs to make sure you have everything set up in a secure way.
