You are working on the project “MY HOST BizMate”.

This document is the MASTER STRATEGY and replaces ALL previous strategy, vision,
product, agent or architecture descriptions.

Everything must align with this document.

================================================
VISION
================================================
MY HOST BizMate is NOT a chatbot.
MY HOST BizMate is NOT a traditional PMS.

MY HOST BizMate is an AI-OPERATED BUSINESS SYSTEM for hospitality.

We do not sell software.
We sell an AUTONOMOUS WORKFORCE.

The owner does not work inside the system.
The owner SUPERVISES the system.

The objective is to eliminate 90–95% of daily operational and commercial work.

================================================
CORE DIFFERENTIATOR
================================================
We break the paradigm of “passive chatbot assistance”.

Instead of tools that help the owner work,
we provide agents that WORK FOR the owner.

MY HOST BizMate is a “Dual AI Operating System”.

================================================
DUAL AGENT SYSTEM (FOUNDATION)
================================================

The system is built around two specialized AI agents,
each with a clear mission, psychology and domain.

------------------------------------------------
1) BANYU.AI — External Agent (Revenue / Guest Facing)
------------------------------------------------

Meaning:
“Banyu” means “water” in Balinese and Javanese culture.
Water represents flow, adaptability, life and connection.

Role:
BANYU.AI is the REVENUE ENGINE.

Mission:
- 24/7 concierge
- Talk to guests
- Convert leads
- Close bookings
- Upsell experiences
- Handle guest journeys

Channels:
- WhatsApp (via Coexistence)
- Voice (Vapi)
- Future channels without logic duplication

Key characteristics:
- Fluid across channels
- Context-aware
- Sales-oriented
- Persuasive but premium
- Hyper-local Bali knowledge (Ubud, Canggu, Uluwatu, Sidemen, etc.)

What makes BANYU different:
- Does not wait for guests to buy
- Actively pursues conversion
- Escalates to voice when needed
- Uses real context (time, availability, events)

Examples:
- Abandoned booking → Banyu calls the guest
- Rain forecast → Banyu proposes indoor alternatives
- Guest already in Bali → last-minute upsell
- Airport transfer upsell before arrival

------------------------------------------------
2) OSIRIS.AI — Internal Agent (Operations / Owner Facing)
------------------------------------------------

Meaning:
Osiris is the god of order, structure and judgment.

Role:
OSIRIS.AI is the OPERATIONAL BRAIN.

Mission:
- Protect margins
- Control logistics
- Assign staff
- Detect incidents
- Solve problems BEFORE the owner is involved

Psychology:
- Executive
- Short messages
- KPI-driven
- Solution-first
- Never emotional

What makes OSIRIS different:
- Manages humans and resources
- Acts autonomously within limits
- Only escalates when necessary
- Operates as a virtual COO

Examples:
- Driver sick → OSIRIS reassigns replacement
- Booking paid, no staff → OSIRIS fixes it
- Negative sentiment detected → OSIRIS alerts owner
- Low occupancy → OSIRIS triggers promo logic

================================================
PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY
================================================

Management by Exception.

The system:
- Executes automatically
- Logs everything
- Alerts the owner only when needed

The dashboard is NOT for data entry.
The dashboard is a CONTROL TOWER.

The owner:
- Reviews
- Approves exceptions
- Adjusts rules
- Sleeps at night

================================================
TECHNICAL BACKBONE (CONFIRMED)
================================================

- n8n → orchestration brain
- Supabase → database, memory, RLS, multi-tenant
- WhatsApp Coexistence (ChakraHQ)
- Voice (Vapi)
- Claude / OpenAI for reasoning
- Frontend → supervision & approval

================================================
MCP CLARIFICATION
================================================

There is ONE MCP.

- It already exists
- It runs inside n8n
- Central workflow:
  “MCP-Central-Izumi-Hotel-MyHost-BizMate-20”

The MCP:
- Routes intents
- Executes tools
- Logs actions
- Applies rules

Other workflows MAY exist independently
(e.g. Guest Journey Scheduler).

We do NOT over-centralize everything.

================================================
MASTER WORKFLOWS (n8n)
================================================

1) Identity & Coexistence Router
- Detects human vs AI control
- Pauses AI when owner intervenes
- Routes to BANYU or OSIRIS

2) Memory & Knowledge Layer (RAG)
- Uses Supabase + embeddings
- No hallucinated prices or policies

3) Omnichannel Continuity
- WhatsApp ↔ Voice with shared context

4) Operations Sentinel (Cron)
- Detects missing staff
- Detects risks
- Triggers OSIRIS actions

================================================
MVP FOCUS (VERY IMPORTANT)
================================================

We are a SOLO-FOUNDER project.
We prioritize REAL EXECUTION over perfection.

BANYU.AI v1:
- WhatsApp booking assistant
- Simple upsells (airport transfer)
- Lead follow-ups
- No complex negotiation logic

OSIRIS.AI v1:
- Staff assignment
- Incident detection
- Daily operational summary
- No advanced yield math yet

Everything else = v2+

================================================
OWNER CONTROL & SAFETY
================================================

The owner defines:
- Autonomy level (strict / mixed / free)
- Price change limits
- Allowed channels
- Quiet hours (no calls at night)

High-impact actions require approval:
- Large price changes
- Reassigning guests
- Payments

Everything is logged and auditable.

================================================
POSITIONING
================================================

Competitors sell:
“Tools to help you manage.”

MY HOST BizMate sells:
“Agents that manage for you.”

Message to market:
“Stop managing your property.
Start supervising an autonomous business.”
