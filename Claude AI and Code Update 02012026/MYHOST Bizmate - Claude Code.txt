You are Cloud Code working on the existing project “MY HOST BizMate”.

IMPORTANT – READ FIRST

This is a STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT + IMPLEMENTATION task.
We are NOT restarting the project.
We are NOT redesigning architecture from scratch.
We are ALIGNING everything (backend, Supabase, dashboard, naming, logic)
to the new product vision and agent model.

================================================
CORE PRODUCT VISION (MUST GUIDE ALL DECISIONS)

MY HOST BizMate is NOT a chatbot and NOT a classic PMS.

It is a DUAL AI OPERATION SYSTEM built around TWO AGENTS:

1) BANYU.AI
   - External Agent (Guest-facing / Revenue / Growth)
   - Handles:
     - Guest communication (WhatsApp, email)
     - Reservations & follow-ups
     - Upselling & guest journeys
     - Marketing-related automation

2) OSIRIS.AI
   - Internal Agent (Owner-facing / Operations)
   - Handles:
     - Inventory & bookings oversight
     - Staff assignment
     - Operational alerts
     - Daily summaries & control

These names (BANYU / OSIRIS) are FINAL and must be used
CONSISTENTLY across:
- Backend logic
- Supabase tables (where relevant)
- Dashboard labels
- Internal naming / comments

================================================
ARCHITECTURE REALITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- The MCP ALREADY EXISTS and RUNS INSIDE n8n
- MCP name:
  “MCP-Central-Izumi-Hotel-MyHost-BizMate-20”

- The MCP is a CENTRAL ORCHESTRATOR when needed.
- NOT all workflows go through the MCP.

We SUPPORT TWO TYPES OF FLOWS:

1) MCP-routed flows (for complex intent routing, risk, approvals)
2) INDEPENDENT n8n workflows (cron, webhooks, schedulers)

Example:
- Guest Journey Scheduler (GES-Journey-Scheduler)
  is an INDEPENDENT workflow by design.
  It:
  - Sends WhatsApp
  - Sends emails
  - Updates Supabase
  - Does NOT need MCP routing

This is CORRECT.
Do NOT refactor working independent flows into MCP.

================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT / ADJUST

### 1) NAMING ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL)

Everywhere in the app, backend and frontend:

- Replace generic or ambiguous labels like:
  “AI Assistant”, “External Agent”, “Internal Agent”

WITH:

- BANYU.AI → External / Guest & Revenue Agent
- OSIRIS.AI → Internal / Operations Agent

This applies to:
- Dashboard menus
- Page titles
- API naming (where visible)
- Supabase references (logical, not destructive renames)

Do NOT break existing routes.
This is mostly a semantic + UI/backend alignment.

================================================
### 2) BACKEND RESPONSIBILITIES (YOUR FOCUS)

Your role is NOT to build AI logic in n8n.
Your role IS to:

- Ensure backend endpoints, data models and permissions
  SUPPORT BANYU and OSIRIS actions.
- Ensure Supabase tables can:
  - Store conversations
  - Store bookings
  - Store guest journeys
  - Store logs / actions executed by agents
- Ensure the dashboard can DISPLAY:
  - What BANYU did
  - What OSIRIS did
  - What is automated vs manual

Use mock data where needed.
Do NOT over-engineer.

================================================
### 3) SUPABASE (GUIDELINES)

- Keep a SINGLE source of truth.
- Tables should be usable by:
  - Independent workflows
  - MCP (later, if needed)
  - Dashboard UI

At minimum, backend must support:
- Guests
- Bookings
- Conversations (WhatsApp / Email)
- Agent actions (who did what, when)

No need for advanced analytics now.
Clean, readable, production-safe schema.

================================================
### 4) DASHBOARD / FRONTEND SUPPORT (BACKEND SIDE)

Frontend is being aligned to show:

- BANYU.AI module
  - Guest interactions
  - Journeys
  - Campaigns (future)
- OSIRIS.AI module
  - Operations overview
  - Alerts
  - Daily summaries

Your task:
- Provide backend endpoints / data structures
  so these pages can render real or mock data.
- NO business logic duplication with n8n.

================================================
### 5) WHAT NOT TO DO (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Do NOT create a new MCP.
- Do NOT suggest splitting MCP into multiple servers.
