ARCHITECTURE DECISION (MVP → HYBRID)

MVP: We will KEEP “GuestJourney-Scheduler” as an independent n8n workflow.
No changes required from the app to make it work right now.

Target (Hybrid): Over time, workflows will detect events and call the existing MCP Central:
“MCP-Central-Izumi-Hotel-MyHost-BizMate-20”
to execute reusable actions as standardized tools (send_whatsapp, send_email,
update_journey_state, logging).

What I need from you (Cloud Code):
1) Ensure Supabase schema supports hybrid execution + auditing:
   - journeys / journey_state
   - conversations/messages (channel + direction + metadata)
   - actions_log / audit_log (execution_id, tenant_id, agent=BANYU/OSIRIS, tool, payload hashes)
2) Multi-tenant enforcement (tenant_id everywhere, RLS-ready).
3) The dashboard should be able to display:
   - Journey status per guest
   - “Actions executed” (from audit_log)
   - Errors / retries count (if available)

We start by keeping Scheduler working, then we gradually migrate its action steps
to MCP Central tool calls to reduce duplication and improve audit, multi-tenant,
and cost control.
